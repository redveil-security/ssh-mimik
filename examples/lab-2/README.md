#  Lab 2 - Main Lab

This is the primary & only lab that'll be used for the event. There's a scenario that goes along with it as well as C2 infrastructure.

# Scenario

Your network has been compromised and attackers have breached several of your internet-accessible networking devices and logs have been wiped clean. Since the devices primarily stored data within the RAM, there were no artifacts that could be easily captured since the adversary power cycled the devices. Luckily, you deployed SSHMimik on one of the compromised devices and logs were forwarded to your logging instance. Your job, analyze the captured logs from the compromised device and figure out what the attackers did.
